# DBWrapper

## What is this project for?

It is often the case that in testing you require a means of validating, verifying and even seeding test data.
This project aims to address that need. In this project we shall use spring and wrap a mysql db.

## Demo

NB: video to be added showing how to interact with the api.

## Performing a test

For an example of how to run a test do the following on the command line in the project root 
*(ensuring to replace the sensitive details correctly)*:

```console
mvn -U clean test -DDB_USER=USERNAME -DDB_NAME=DATABASE_NAME -DDB_PASS=DATAASE_PASSWORD
```
